# datamodels

##Â An ontology and associated code for working with data models.

The requirement behind datamodels is to be able to easily and rapidly ingest a collection of datamodels from a range of sources and authoring tools into a single location.

This might be in the context of performing some analysis, or prior to a migration from one set of data modelling tooling to another. 

The ontology specifies a set of serialization schemas which, along with the associated python code, allows upload of contents from relatively simple csv-style data feeds.
